Problem 12. Development Environments

Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short list with popular development 
environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio. Write in a text file called “list-of-IDEs.txt” at least five 
IDEs along with 2-3 sentences about each of them. Use English.

Code::Blocks

Code::Blocks is a free, open source cross-platform IDE which supports multiple compilers including GCC, 
Clang and Visual C++. It is developed in C++ using wxWidgets as the GUI toolkit. Using a plugin architecture, 
its capabilities and features are defined by the provided plugins. Currently, Code::Blocks is oriented towards 
C, C++, and Fortran. It has a custom build system and optional Make support.
Code::Blocks is being developed for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X and has been ported to FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Solaris.

Dev-C++

Dev-C++ is a free full-featured integrated development environment (IDE) distributed under the 
GNU General Public License for programming in C and C++. It is written in Delphi.
It is bundled with, and uses, the MinGW or TDM-GCC 64bit port of the GCC as its compiler. 
Dev-C++ can also be used in combination with Cygwin or any other GCC-based compiler.
Dev-C++ is generally considered a Windows-only program, but there are attempts to create a Linux version:
 header files and path delimiters are switchable between platforms.

Eclipse

Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE). It contains a base workspace and an 
extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. Written mostly in Java, 
Eclipse can be used to develop applications. By means of various plug-ins, 
Eclipse may also be used to develop applications in other programming languages: 
Ada, ABAP, C, C++, COBOL, Fortran, Haskell, JavaScript, Lasso, Lua, Natural, Perl, PHP, Prolog, Python, R, 
Ruby (including Ruby on Rails framework), Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Scheme, and Erlang. 
It can also be used to develop packages for the software Mathematica. 
Development environments include the Eclipse Java development tools (JDT) for Java and Scala, 
Eclipse CDT for C/C++ and Eclipse PDT for PHP, among others.

Android Studio

Android Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for developing on the Android platform. 
It was announced on May 16, 2013 at the Google I/O conference by Google's Product Manager, Katherine Chou. 
Android Studio is freely available under the Apache License 2.0.
Android Studio was in early access preview stage starting from version 0.1 in May 2013, 
then entered beta stage starting from version 0.8 which was released in June 2014. 
The first stable build was released in December 2014, starting from version 1.0.
Based on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software, Android Studio is designed specifically for Android development.
It is available for download on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, and replaced Eclipse Android Development Tools (ADT)
as Google's primary IDE for native Android application development.

KDevelop

KDevelop is a free software integrated development environment (IDE) for the KDE Platform on Unix-like 
computer operating systems. KDevelop includes no compiler; instead,
it uses an external compiler such as GCC or Clang to produce executable binaries.
The current version, 4.7.1, was officially released on 6 February 2015, and will be the last version to use
Qt 4 and KDElibs 4, as the next major release will rely on Qt 5 and KDE Frameworks 5. 
It builds on various KDE Platform 4 technologies and supports C, C++, PHP and Python development, among others.
The last stable release of the previous major version, 3.5.5, which is based on 
K Desktop Environment 3 technology, supports many programming languages such as 
Ada, Bash, C, C++, Fortran, Java, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby.
Released under the GNU General Public License, KDevelop is free software.
